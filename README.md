## Description
![logo](https://github.com/JonathSpirit/FastEngine/blob/master/logo.png?raw=true) FastEngine is a multiplayer oriented framework-ish on top of the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library. It brings a lot of tools and classes that can help mostly game development.

### Compiler support

- For GNU/Linux : GCC-11 minimum
- For Windows : MINGW-W64, GCC-11 minimum

Unsupported compiler/tools :
- Microsoft compiler, (it should work but is not tested on)
- Ninja build system

FastEngine is built under C++20 but game/software that link to this library can be C++17 minimum
